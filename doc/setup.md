# Setup instructions

## Getting the API and data

The package is accessible on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and therefore installs with pip. You can download it from there with

```
pip install cptac
```

## Setting up for Jupyter notebooks
If you want the package available within Jupyter, you can install it in your base conda environment. To do this, open a bash shell and run the following:
```
conda activate
pip install cptac
```

## Opening the data in Python
After installation, open Python anywhere on your system and import our package by entering:

```
import cptac
```

The package should load automatically and print progress to the screen. See the tutorial examples in the doc folder.
