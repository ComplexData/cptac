# Tutorials

Tutorials for this package describe how to use the package for research. All the tutorials are written in python using the interactive jupyter notebooks. If you are unfamiliar with jupyter, follow the instructions given at jupyter.org/install to begin running jupyter on your machine. You will then be able to run our documentation as interactive, jupyter-based tutorials.

Use Case 1: Comparing transcriptomics and proteomics for a single gene

Use Case 2: Looking for correlation between various clinical factors, such as BMI, diabetes, and cancer stage

Use Case 3: Using Spearman correlation to find genes significantly correlated with a clinical attribute

Use Case 4: Investigating how genetic mutation affects protein abundance

Use Case 5: Running gene set enrichment analysis - which pathways are differentially expressed based on microsatellite instability
