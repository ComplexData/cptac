# devdocs

These documents give instructions for developers working on the cptac package. They are also useful for others who are working on forks of the repository, or adapting the code for their own uses. **NOTE: Whenever you make any changes to the repository, follow the instructions in [05_HOW_TO_ADD_CODE.md](05_HOW_TO_ADD_CODE.md)**. This will avoid merge conflicts.
